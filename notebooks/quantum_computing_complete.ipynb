    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Gates Must Be Matrices\n",

    "Remember: quantum states are **vectors**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical fact:** To transform a vector, you multiply by a **matrix**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Basic Operation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gate application = Matrix-vector multiplication**\n",
    "\n",

    "## The Fundamental Constraint: Unitarity\n",
    "\n",
    "Not every matrix is a valid quantum gate. Quantum gates must be **unitary matrices**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Unitary Matrix?\n",
    "\n",
    "A matrix $U$ is **unitary** if:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$U^\\dagger U = I$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $U^\\dagger$ = conjugate transpose of $U$ (also written $U^*$ or $U^T$)\n",
    "- $I$ = identity matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "**In words:** When you multiply a unitary matrix by its conjugate transpose, you get the identity matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Unitary?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Three equivalent reasons:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Preserve normalization:**\n",
    "   - Input: $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$ (normalized)\n",
    "   - Output: $\\langle U\\psi|U\\psi\\rangle = 1$ (still normalized)\n",
    "   - Unitarity ensures probabilities still sum to 100%\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reversibility:**\n",
    "   - Quantum evolution is reversible in time\n",
    "   - For every gate $U$, there's an inverse $U^{-1} = U^\\dagger$\n",
    "   - You can always \"undo\" a quantum operation\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Preserve inner products:**\n",
    "   - $\\langle U\\phi|U\\psi\\rangle = \\langle\\phi|\\psi\\rangle$\n",
    "   - Quantum mechanics requires this (preserves physical information)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-Unitary = Physically Impossible\n",
    "\n",
    "**This matrix is NOT unitary:**\n",
    "$$\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we applied it to $|0\\rangle$:\n",
    "$$\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalization: $|2|^2 + |0|^2 = 4 \\neq 1$ ✗\n",

    "This violates quantum mechanics! Cannot be a physical gate.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Properties of Quantum Gates\n",
    "\n",
    "Valid quantum gates have these properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Deterministic Transformation**\n",
    "Given input state, gate produces **definite** output state.\n",
    "(The randomness comes from measurement, not gate application)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Linear**\n",
    "$$U(\\alpha|\\psi_1\\rangle + \\beta|\\psi_2\\rangle) = \\alpha U|\\psi_1\\rangle + \\beta U|\\psi_2\\rangle$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Superpositions are preserved and transformed linearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Reversible**\n",
    "Every gate $U$ has an inverse $U^\\dagger$.\n",
    "$$U^\\dagger U = U U^\\dagger = I$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Continuous**\n",
    "Quantum gates are continuous transformations (rotations in Hilbert space).\n",
    "No \"jumps\" or discontinuities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Energy Preserving**\n",

    "- Self-inverse: $H^2 = I$\n",

    "### 3. **Phase Gates** (Add relative phase)\n",
    "\n",
    "**S gate (phase gate):**\n",
    "$$S = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & i \\end{pmatrix}$$\n",

    "- $S = \\sqrt{Z}$ (square root of Z)\n",
    "\n",
